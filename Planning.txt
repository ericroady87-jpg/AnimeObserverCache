As a user, I want to be able to add new anime's or movies that I'm interested in watching or have already started watching. 
    For each title, I should be able to make comments and note down things like the anime/ movie title, the genre, status of viewing, 
    and if I want, some personal notes and the link of where to watch.

As a user, I want to see all the shows I've added in one location. 
    This page should show the anime/movie title and the genre for each title to keep it simple. 

As a user, I need to be able to click on any show title in my list and see all the details about it on a new page. 
    This includes everything I've inputed about that show.

As a user, when I'm looking at all the details of a show, I want to be able to alter the details. 
    There should be an easy-to-find link that takes me to a different page where I can make these changes and then save them.

As a user, if I'm looking at the details of any given title, I want a simple way to delete it completely, like by clicking a "Delete" button.
